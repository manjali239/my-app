Real-Time Telecom Power Supply Monitoring System
Overview
This project is a full-stack web application designed for real-time monitoring of telecom power supply systems. It provides a user-friendly interface to display real-time sensor data, including voltage, current, and temperature, with interactive visualizations and controls. The backend is powered by Firebase to ensure efficient data processing, real-time updates, and reliable storage and retrieval of sensor data.

Features
Real-Time Data Monitoring: Displays real-time sensor data for voltage, current, and temperature.
Interactive Visualizations: Provides interactive charts and controls for better data visualization.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use React front-end for seamless user experience.
Efficient Data Processing: Utilizes Firebase for real-time data processing and updates.
Robust Storage and Retrieval: Ensures reliable storage and retrieval of sensor data using Firebase.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, Chart.js (or any other visualization library)
Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Realtime Database)
State Management: React Hooks, Context API
Authentication: Firebase Authentication
